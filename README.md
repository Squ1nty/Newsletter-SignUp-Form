## Overview

The goal was to build out a newsletter form and get it looking as close to the design as possible while ensuring proper input validation and web responsiveness.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN WebDocs Client-Side Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation) - This page really helped me in providing a step by step resource to gradually learn the ins-and-outs of form validation. In future, I will definitely continue to use MDN WebDocs as a guide thanks to their simple to understand yet extensive database of information.
- Outside of this website, with obvious help from quick google searches, countless hours on stackOverflow and other threads, I was able to learn and discover new techniques to solve this challenge.

## Acknowledgments

I wanted to thank all those who provided me helpful advice in my previous projects, as I believe I was better able to adhere to industry standards and workflows this time around as compared to older projects. Examples of growth include: usage of alt and aria-label attributes in HTML, proficient use of media queries when styling for a mobile-first approach and being able to create a efficient and elegant JavaScript implementation to provide itneractivity for the form.
